        "ground_truth": "CGM in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes offers several benefits, including improved glycemic control, reduction in hypoglycemia, and increased time in the target glucose range. CGM provides real-time glucose values and trends, allowing for more informed therapy adjustments. It can also help in detecting postprandial hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, including asymptomatic episodes. Furthermore, CGM use has been linked to improved quality of life and can be integrated with insulin delivery devices to create closed-loop systems. Specialized diabetes teams utilizing CGM have also shown benefits such as lower rates of hyperglycemia and potentially financial advantages through reduced readmission rates and shorter hospital stays.",
